# Buffer List

****** 
This is forked from [kilavila/nvim-bufferlist](https://github.com/kilavila/nvim-bufferlist)
These are the chages I added:
1. Added buffers actual numbers for easy access
2. Added key maps to switch buffers using numbers on keyboard
3. Removed the current buffer marker '>' and added added the buffer name title intead ( Does not mess with numbering this way )
